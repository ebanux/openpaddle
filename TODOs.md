# Future Features & Enhancements

This document outlines the roadmap for potential new features and improvements for the Monetization Showcase application.

---

## ðŸ”® Core Functionality

- **Full AI Page Generation:** Implement the "Generate with AI" feature to take a high-level user prompt and create a fully configured page from scratchâ€”selecting the best use case, populating all fields, and generating relevant images.
- **Real Backend & Database:** Replace all simulated logic (`localStorage`, mock payments) with a real backend service and a database (e.g., Firebase, Supabase, or a custom Node.js server with PostgreSQL) for true persistence of user data, pages, and sessions.
- **Real User Authentication:** Transition from the simulated login modal to a complete authentication system (e.g., OAuth 2.0 with Google/GitHub, JWT-based sessions).

## ðŸ’³ Stripe & Payments

- **Full Stripe API Integration:**
  - Create real Stripe Payment Links or Checkout Sessions via a backend service.
  - Implement Stripe Webhooks to listen for events like `checkout.session.completed` to trigger actions in the application (e.g., updating a session record in the database).
  - Integrate with the Stripe Customer Portal API to provide a seamless management experience.
  - Validate and apply real Stripe Promotion Codes.
- **Expanded Payment Methods:** Add support for more payment methods available through Stripe (e.g., Apple Pay, Google Pay, Klarna, Afterpay).

## ðŸŽ¨ Editor & UI/UX

- **Advanced Form Fields:** Introduce more sophisticated form field types, such as a rich text editor, a dedicated date/time picker, a color picker, or a direct file uploader for images.
- **Full Mobile Responsiveness:** Design a fully responsive layout for the editor panel itself, ensuring a great user experience on mobile devices and tablets.
- **Accessibility (a11y) Audit:** Conduct a thorough review to ensure the application meets WCAG standards, improving semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Add support for multiple languages in the editor UI and provide tools for users to create multilingual pages.

## ðŸ“ˆ Platform Growth

- **Analytics Dashboard:** Create a dashboard for users to view key metrics for their pages, such as page views, successful payments, and conversion rates.
- **Team Collaboration:** Allow multiple users to be part of an organization and collaborate on creating and managing pages.
- **Custom Domains:** Enable users to connect their own custom domains to their published pages for a fully white-labeled experience.
