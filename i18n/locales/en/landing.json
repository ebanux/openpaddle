        { "q": "How do payouts work?", "a": "We offer two flexible options. For a quick start, you can provide your Payoneer or Wise details for manual payouts (higher fees apply). For lower fees and direct payouts, you can onboard with Stripe Connect. This links your own Stripe account to the platform, giving you full control over your funds, refunds, and disputes. You can start with the quick option and upgrade anytime." },
        { "q": "Do I need a Stripe account to use this?", "a": "Not to get started! You can use our 'Quick Start' option without any Stripe account. To get lower fees and direct payouts, you will need to connect your own Stripe account, which is a simple and secure process within our dashboard." },
        { "q": "What happens if I don't register an account?", "a": "You can use the app fully in 'Guest Mode' (equivalent to our Quick Start tier with stricter limits). Any pages you create will be stored in your browser's local storage. This is perfect for testing, but to save your work permanently and access full features, you'll need to create a free account." },
        { "q": "Can I sell physical goods that require shipping?", "a": "Yes. The platform supports collecting shipping addresses. While it's optimized for digital goods and services, you can absolutely use it for physical products." }
