# Face Sheet & Layup

The face, or "skin," of the paddle is the point of contact with the ball, critical for spin and durability.

- **Primary Material**: 3K Raw Carbon Fiber (T700)
  - T700-grade carbon fiber provides a stiff, durable surface with excellent texture for generating spin. "3K" refers to the weave pattern.

- **Hybrid Option**: Carbon + Kevlar blend
  - A potential alternative under discussion, which could offer a different feel and durability profile.

- **Weave & Layup**: Twill weave, 3-ply (CCC - Carbon/Core/Carbon)
  - The standard layup for a responsive and consistent feel across the paddle face.
