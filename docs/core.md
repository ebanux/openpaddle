# Core Material & Structure

The core is the engine of the paddle, defining its power, control, and feel.

- **Material**: Polypropylene honeycomb
  - The industry standard for its balance of durability, performance, and weight.

- **Structure**: Honeycomb with a perimeter foam wall
  - The foam wall increases the sweet spot, adds stability on off-center hits, and reduces vibration.

- **Thickness Options**:
  - **14mm**: Generally preferred for players seeking more power and "pop".
  - **16mm**: Generally preferred for players seeking more control and a softer feel.

*Community voting will determine the primary thickness for the first production run.*
