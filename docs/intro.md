# Open Spec Paddle — Draft 0.0

Welcome to the living specification for the OpenPaddle project. This is where we, as a community, define every detail of the paddle we're building together.

Our goal is radical transparency and community-driven design. Every material, dimension, and construction choice is documented here. Use these documents to understand the current state of the design, and then head over to our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/open-paddle-project/hub/discussions) to debate, propose changes, and vote on the final product.

This is your paddle—help us build it right.
