# Construction Method

How the layers are bonded together determines the paddle's durability and overall performance characteristics.

- **Method**: Thermoformed sandwich panel
  - A modern technique where heat and pressure are used to bond the face sheets to the core. This creates a strong, unibody construction that is highly durable and provides a crisp, responsive feel.

- **Edge**: Integrated perimeter foam (Gen2 Unibody)
  - The foam injected around the perimeter is part of the thermoforming process, creating a seamless and reinforced edge that improves stability and enlarges the effective hitting area.

- **Optional Consideration**: Widened foam edge (Gen3)
  - A newer trend involving a wider foam injection. We are evaluating this for future iterations based on community feedback on its impact on swing weight and stability.
